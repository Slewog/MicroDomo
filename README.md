# MicroDomo APK + arduino code
This is a code in C ++ that I wrote for my lamp controlled in bluetooth with an Arduino UNO microcontroller carried out during my training dear Microbus.

Content :
- APK.
- Arduino program.

How to install : 
1 : Install the APK on an Android smartphone or to use the program take a BT terminal with a "On" function which sends "1", "SOS" which sends "2", "Blink" which sends "3" and "Off" which sends '0'

2 : Upload the arduino program to an arduino. Remember to disconnect the HC-05 module if the program upload fails
